# Drug-Synergy-Prediction-using-Graph-Neural-Networks

Abstract: While computational methods are emerging progressively, our paper focuses on implementing deep
learning techniques to compute a viable score for a combination of drug effects on cancer cells. Drug combination
therapies are an ingrained concept in cancer treatment. Hence, identifying the novel synergistic combinations is
what we are focusing on here. Our models use the chemical structure of drugs and genomic information of various
cancer cell lines as input information, a normalization strategy to justify the input data heterogeneity, and tapered
layers to model drug synergies.
Keywords: Cancer cell lines, Chemical Structures, Protein-Protein Interaction, Graph Convolutional Neural
network, Graph Neural Network, Message Passing Neural Network, Mean Squared Error.
